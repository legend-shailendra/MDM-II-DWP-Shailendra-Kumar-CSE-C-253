📌 Project Description

This project is based on the research findings regarding optimal web-interface design for "digital natives".
It focuses on designing and implementing a "Well-Designed Calculator Tool"  that minimizes cognitive load and maximizes task efficiency compared to text-based alternatives.

The system provides an automated solution for users to calculate their daily caloric needs using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation, replacing the need for manual calculation or dense information retrieval.


🔹 Project Overview

The Calorie Calculator UI is developed using modern web design principles to create a clean, medical-grade, and highly responsive interface.

The interface includes:

Automated BMR and TDEE calculation logic 

Dynamic toggle for Metric (kg/cm) and Imperial (lbs/ft) units

Interactive "Activity Level" selection cards with visual descriptors 

Real-time result generation without page reloads

The project demonstrates the practical application of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)  by reducing extraneous load through intuitive design.

✨ Key Features

✅ Research-Backed Design – Prioritizes visual immediacy and automation.

✅ Dual Unit Support – Seamless switching between English and Metric systems.

✅ Smart Form Inputs – Gender, Age, Height, Weight, and Goal inputs.

✅ Visual Activity Selectors – Cards for Sedentary to Extremely Active levels.

✅ Instant Feedback – Immediate calculation results to enhance user satisfaction.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Semantic structure of the calculator application.

CSS3 (Tailwind) – Utility-first styling for a responsive, modern layout.


🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a high-performance web interface that empirically reduces user effort and improves task success rates.

It demonstrates:

Implementation of user-centered design (UCD) principles.

Reduction of "extraneous cognitive load" through UI optimization.

Responsive and accessible form design.


This project serves as a functional prototype for health-tech applications, aligning with the expectations of modern digital users for speed and visual clarity.
