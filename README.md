📌 Project Description

This project implements the findings of a research study that evaluates how interface design affects user performance in calorie calculation tasks.
The study compares interactive calculators against text-based websites, measuring their impact on:

Task completion time 

Cognitive load (mental effort) 

User satisfaction and usability 

🔹 Project Overview

The project demonstrates that visually rich, tool-based interfaces significantly outperform text-heavy alternatives.

The implemented interface focuses on:


Automation: Removing the need for manual math.

Visual Immediacy: Providing instant feedback.

Cognitive Efficiency: Reducing extraneous mental load.

✨ Key Findings

✅ User Preference: 84.4% of users selected the well-designed calculator over other options.

✅ Performance: Task completion was significantly faster (52s vs 135s) with the optimized tool.

✅ Cognitive Load: Users reported significantly lower mental demand scores.

❌ Text-based Sites: consistently avoided due to high effort requirements.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Interface structure

CSS3 – Styling and responsive layout

🎯 Objective
The objective is to apply Cognitive Load Theory to web design, demonstrating that interactive tools minimize "extraneous load" and maximize user efficiency. This serves as a model for optimizing public service and educational web systems.
